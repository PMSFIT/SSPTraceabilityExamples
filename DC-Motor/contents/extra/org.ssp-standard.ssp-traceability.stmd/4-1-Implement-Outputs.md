**Phase 4 step 1 Implement Simulation Model(s)**

In this process step, the simulation sub-models are implemented and integrated to the simulation model. Quality assurance is performed, both individually for the sub-models and in their interaction as simulation model. There are two kinds of inputs for this step. Firstly, the information about the simulation setup in which the model should finally run. This information is needed to clarify and give background information for the implementation. Secondly, the information about the design specification and requirements for the specific simulation setups in which the model and sub-models has to be developed and the specific model assurances has to be performed. The quality assurance within the "target" simulation environment is carried out in step 6 of phase 4.

**Outputs:**
- **Implemented and documented models and sub-models according to requirement and design specifications**
  - The electrical part of the DC motor and stimuli block comes with documentation as FMUs from library.
  - The mechanical part of the DC motor is implemented and tested in a sub-task CMP as FMU.
  - Links to SSP and FMUs, and missing documentation need to be added.
  - **In this simple example there is no difference between the simulation setup in which the model finally runs and the setup in which the model and sub-models are developed. Therefore the results from testing and validation are combined in step 6 of phase 4. No additional tests and documentation in this step**


- **Credibility documentation:**
  - **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
    - The electrical part of the DC motor and stimuli block comes with documentation as FMUs from library.
    - The mechanical part of the DC motor is implemented and tested in a sub-task CMP as FMU.
