**Phase 6 step 3 Derive Simulation Quality Verdict**

An assessment of the quality of the simulation task and result is carried out. This can be domain or company specific.

**Outputs:**

* **Quality verdict about simulation result**
    * Evaluation with positive result of quality assurance of simulation setup and simulation results by simulation and domain experts.
