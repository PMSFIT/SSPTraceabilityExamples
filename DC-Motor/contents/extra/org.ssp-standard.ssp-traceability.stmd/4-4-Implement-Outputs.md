**Phae 4 step 4 Implement Simulation Environment Modules**

In this process step, the simulation environment modules, workflow and data flow are implemented and integrated to the simulation environment. Quality assurance is performed, both individually for the modules and in their interaction.

There are two kinds of inputs for this step. Firstly, the information about the simulation setup in which the (software) modules, workflow and data flow should finally run. This information is needed to clarify and give background information for the design specification. Secondly, the information about the design specification and requirements for the specific simulation setup in which the modules and workflow have to be developed and the specific module and workflow assurance has to be performed. The quality assurance with the "target" model and test cases is carried out in step 6 of phase 4.

**Outputs:**
- **Implemented and documented modules and simulation environment, workflow and data flow according to requirement and design specifications**
  - This simple example uses the infrastructure of the simulation tool XX.
- **Quality assurance of modules and simulation environment**
- **Specific quality assurance of modules and simulation environment according to the prescribed models**
  - This simple example uses the infrastructure of the simulation tool XX, expert opinion for quality assurance.

- **Credibility documentation:**
  - **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
