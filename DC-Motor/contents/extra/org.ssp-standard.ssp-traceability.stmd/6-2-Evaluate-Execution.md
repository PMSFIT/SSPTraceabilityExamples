**Phase 6 step 2 Assure Simulation Quality**

In this process step quality assurance for the simulation task and result is performed. Quality information about the simulation experiments is provided, according to the criticality of the decision of the simulation task. As input the results from process step 6 of phase 4 "Assure Simulation Setup Quality" and step 7 of phase 4 "Derive Simulation Setup Quality Verdict" are used:

- Quality assurance for simulation setup according to requirement and design specifications
- Quality assurance results
- Quality verdict about simulation setup (models, parameters, test cases, simulation environment)

Main focus is then the influence of the specific settings (parameters, operating points, solver settings, â€¦).

This can be domain or company specific.

**Process execution:**
- Provide quality information about simulation experiments according to the criticality of the decision of the simulation task
