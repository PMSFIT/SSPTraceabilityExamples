**Phase 7 Fulfillment**

In this process phase the decision is made whether the requirements and objectives of the simulation task have been fulfilled. This is done in coordination with the higher-level process (Simulation-based Engineering Task). Further information available in the higher-level process can also be taken into account (e.g. results of other test tasks), as cross information of other test tasks of the engineering process can be useful input.

**Process execution:**

* Decide about fulfilment of simulation objectives
