**Phase 5 Execute Simulation**

In this process phase the simulation itself as well as simulation experiments relevant for the following evaluation and quality assurance are carried out. Single simulations, a given set of simulations or iterative simulations can be performed here. Phase 5 and 6 are an iterative process, results are documented in the according phases.

**Process execution:**

* **Execute simulation according to simulation task**
    * The simulation starts with all state variables 0 (current, speed, position). Voltage 12 V and load torque-0.5 Nm is applied. Simulation should run for 1.0 sec. Evaluation if after 1 sec 50 rad/s are reached.
