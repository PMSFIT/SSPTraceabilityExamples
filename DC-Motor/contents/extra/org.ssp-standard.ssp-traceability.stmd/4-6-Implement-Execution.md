**Phase 4 step 6 Assure Simulation Setup Quality**

In this process step quality assurance (i.e. tests) for the simulation environment with integrated models and parametrization is performed. Quality information about models and simulation environment according to the criticality of the decision of the simulation task is provided. This can be domain or company specific.

**Process execution:**
- Assure quality for simulation setup (simulation environment with integrated models and parametrization) with tests and quality assuring methods
- Provide quality information about model and simulation environment according to criticality of decision of simulation task
