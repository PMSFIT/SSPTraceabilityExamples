**Phase 7 Fulfilment**

In this process phase the decision is made whether the requirements and objectives of the simulation task have been fulfilled. This is done in coordination with the higher-level process (Simulation-based Engineering Task). Further information available in the higher-level process can also be taken into account (e.g. results of other test tasks), as cross information of other test tasks of the engineering process can be useful input.

**Outputs:**

* **Decision about fulfillment of simulation objectives**
    * Fulfillment of objectives: The DC motor accelerates from 0 to 50 rad/s in less than 0.5 s (simulation result: 0,3s) at 12 V applied voltage and a load torque of -0.5 Nm.
    * Evaluation with positive result of quality assurance of simulation setup and simulation results by simulation and domain experts.
* **Credibility documentation:**
    * **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
