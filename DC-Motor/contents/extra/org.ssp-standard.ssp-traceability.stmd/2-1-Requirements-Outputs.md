**Phase 2, step 1 Define Requirements for Simulation Integration**

In step 1 "Define Requirements for Simulation Integration" of phase 2 the framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfill are clarified. Also, the requirements of the simulation task are broken down into the individual requirements for the simulation integration elements. This is an iterative process between all steps of phase 2.

**Outputs:**

* **Requirements for simulation integration (also requirements for the assembly and interaction of the elements of the simulation setup, execution and evaluation, including operation range)**
    * The simulation environment should cover a range from -2000 to +2000 rad/s and loads from -2 to +2 Nm. A simulation environment which is used in similar applications should be used.
    * Specific test for simulation integration: Tests with -48 V, -24 V, -12 V, 0 V, 12 V24 V, 48 V, in combination with -2, -1, -0.5, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 Nm load.
* **Specific quality requirements for the simulation integration**
    * Plausibility check with experts and comparison with static end values.
* **Credibility documentation:**
    * **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
        * Open point.
