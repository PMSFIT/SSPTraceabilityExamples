**Phase 3 step 1 Define Design Specification Simulation Integration**

**Inputs:**

* **Design specification for simulation integration (also design specification for the assembly and interaction of the elements of the simulation setup, execution and evaluation, including operation range**)
    * For larger applications the simulation environment and the models are developed and tested separately. Here it is described how the interaction a should work.
    * In this simple example the FMUs of the electrical and mechanical part are loaded as SSP into simulator xxx and are parameterized with the parameter set.
    * The output of the stimuli block model is connected to the input U of the motor model.
    * The FMU co-simulation environment YY version aa has to be used.
    * The described simulation setup tests have to be performed and evaluated by experts.
* **Specific quality design specifications for the simulation integration (i.e. integration tests**)
    * Quality assurance: Specific test for simulation setup:
        * Tests with -48 V, -24 V, -12 V, 0 V, 12 V24 V, 48 V, in combination with -2, -1, -0.5, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 Nm load..
        * Start values of the state variables are 0.
        * Plausibility check with expert opinion and comparison with static end values, these are determined by the model equations.
        * Additional test with variation of the resistance value (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0,5, 1.0 and 1.5 Ohm).
