**Phase 3 step 3 Define Design Specification Parameters**

In this process step, the design specification for the parameters is determined from the requirements. Here it is important to know how the quality assurance of the parameters or the chain from the data source to the parameter is realized and how the quality of the parameters is determined. The implementation aspects are important when for example material data is processed for the data input of the models, parameter structures are used for model structures, or the infrastructure for handling different parameter sets has to be defined.
As an output also the specific subset of the design specification of the other steps of phase 3 has to be provided (simulation integration, models, test cases, simulation environment). This information is needed for clarification for the implementation of the parameters. This is an iterative process between all steps in phase 3. The results are documented in the specific steps.

**Process execution:**
- Definition of design specification for parameters
- Linkage to data sheets, measurements, material data
- Definition of design specification of quality assurance for parameters
- Create necessary subset of information for parameter implementation from the outputs of the other steps of phase 3
