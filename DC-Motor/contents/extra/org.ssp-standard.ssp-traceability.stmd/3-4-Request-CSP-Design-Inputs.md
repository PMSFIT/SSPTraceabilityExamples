**Phase 3 step 4 Define Design Specification Test Cases**

**Inputs:**

* **Design specification for test cases (the test case or optimization or analysis criteria targeting the simulation objective**)
    * In this simple example there is no difference between Requirement and Design Specification. For more extensive tests the structure of the tests (reuse, modularization) should be defined here.
    * **Target Simulation:**
        * The simulation starts with all state variables 0 (current, speed, position).
        * Voltage 12 V and load torque -0.5 Nm is applied. Simulation should run for 1.0 sec.
        * Evaluation if after 1 sec 50 rad/s are reached.
* **Specific quality design specifications for the test cases**
    * Test cases and evaluation approach have to be proved by experts.
