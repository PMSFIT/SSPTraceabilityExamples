**Phase2 step4 Define Requirements for Test Cases**

In step 4 "Define Requirements for Simulation Test Cases" of phase 2 the framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfill are clarified. Also, the requirements of the simulation task are broken down into the individual requirements for the test cases. This is an iterative process between all steps of phase 2.

**Process Execution:**
- Clarification of framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfill
- Break down of the requirements of the simulation task into the individual requirements for the test cases (or optimization see introduction)
