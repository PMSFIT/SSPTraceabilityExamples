**Phase 2, step 1 Define Requirements for Simulation Integration**

**Inputs:**

* **Requirements for simulation integration (also requirements for the assembly and interaction of the elements of the simulation setup, execution and evaluation, including operation range)**
    * The simulation environment should cover a range from -2000 to +2000 rad/s and loads from -2 to +2 Nm. A simulation environment which is used in similar applications should be used.
    * Specific test for simulation integration: Tests with -48 V, -24 V, -12 V, 0 V, 12 V,24 V, 48 V, in combination with -2, -1, -0.5, -0.1, 0, 0.1,0.5, 1, 2 Nm load.
* **Specific quality requirements for the simulation integration**
    * Plausibility check with experts and comparison with static end values.
