**Phase 4 step 5 Integrate Simulation Environment, Models, Parameters**

In this process step the models with their parametrization and tests (or the optimization or analysis functionality) are integrated in the simulation environment. Integration tests are implemented and performed according to the specific quality design specifications. Phase 4 is an iterative process between steps 1 to 6, specially step 5 and 6. The results of this iterative process are documented in the according steps.


**Outputs:**
- **Implemented, integrated and documented simulation setup according to requirement and design specifications**
  - Links to setup files, simulation results of tests, and quality assurance (has to be added).
  - Step size should be < 0.0001 s 
 
- **Credibility documentation:**
  - **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
