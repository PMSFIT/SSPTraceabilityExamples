**Phase 4 step 7 Derive Simulation Setup Quality Verdict**

An assessment of the quality of the simulation setup and according models, test cases, parametrization and simulation environment is carried out (according to the criticality of the simulation task). This can be domain or company specific.

**Outputs:**

* **Quality information of simulation setup (models, parameters, test cases, simulation environment**)
* **Quality verdict about simulation setup**
    * A formal quality verdict is not performed in this example, according to the low impact of the decision based on the result.
* **Credibility documentation:**
    * **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
