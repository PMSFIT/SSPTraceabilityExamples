**Phase2 step4 Define Requirements for Test Cases**

In step 4 "Define Requirements for Simulation Test Cases" of phase 2 the framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfil are clarified. Also, the requirements of the simulation task are broken down into the individual requirements for the test cases. This is an iterative process between all steps of phase 2.

**Outputs:**

* **Requirements for test cases (the test cases or optimization criteria targeting the simulation objective**)
    * The simulation starts with all state variables 0 (current, speed, position).
    * Voltage 12 V and load torque -0.5 Nm is applied.
    * Simulation should run for 1.0 sec.
    * Evaluation if after 0.5 sec 50 rad/s are reached.
* **Specific quality requirements for the cases**
    * Assurance of the results and used resources by expert assessment and plausibility tests is sufficient.
* **Credibility documentation:**
    * **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
