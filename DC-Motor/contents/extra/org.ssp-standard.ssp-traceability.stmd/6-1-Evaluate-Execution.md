**Phase 6 step 1 Evaluate Simulation Results**

In this process step the post processing of simulation results and for the quality of results is performed. That often means the visualization of simulation results according to the simulation task requirements.

**Process execution:**

* Post processing of simulation results and quality of results
* Visualization of simulation results according simulation task requirements
