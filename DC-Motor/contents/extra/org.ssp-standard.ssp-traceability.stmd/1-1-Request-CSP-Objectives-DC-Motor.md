**Objectives**

* **Product /System under Test with version information** (mandatory)
    (Specification of the sample type (e.g. A-sample, B-sample) or the SW status (e.g. CAT and version numbers) which is subject to the simulation (System under Test SuT).)
    * DC motor with the type part number XY12346
* **Engineering task** (mandatory)
    (Description of the top-level engineering task (e.g. development of an AD driving function based on camera signals) and the specific engineering task (e.g. detection of critical occlusions when turning right with pedestrians).)
    * **Top-level engineering task**
        * A variant of a window lifter based on the DDC platform is to be developed.
        * This application is a low cost variant.
    * **specific engineering task**
        * The sub-task here is to make a pre-selection for a suitable DC electric motor in the early phase of the project.
        * It is to be examined whether the DC motor with the type part number XY12346 is suitable in principle.
        * Rationale: The DC motor type part number XY12345 is already used in automotive projects and meets the specific requirements for the application (temperature, vibration resistance, ...).
* **Simulation Service Target** (mandatory)
    (The simulation service target details the scope of the ordered simulation service with respect to the engineering task (e.g. assessment of the camera resolution by simulation).
    * Implementation and execution of a simulation based on a simple DC motor model.
    * The effects which should be considered and neglected should be agreed on with experts.
* **Simulation Objectives (including KPI and other criteria)** (mandatory)
    (Simulation objectives describe the quantities of interest and the target values (e.g. the distance between vehicle and pedestrian must be higher than 1.5m).)
    * The DC motor must be able to accelerate from 0 to 50 rad/s within 0.5 s at 12 V applied voltage and a load torque of -0.5 Nm.
* **Explanation why simulation was chosen as solution approach for the engineering task** (optional)
    * Rationale: Same approach in similar engineering tasks was performed successfully.
* **Quality aspects according to the criticality of the decision of the engineering task** (mandatory)
    * Potential risk and damage in case of misjudgement limited (additional development effort < 4 person weeks).
    * Sufficient validation of the results and tools used by expert opinion and plausibility tests.
