**Phase 2, step 1 Define Requirements for Simulation Integration**

In step 1 "Define Requirements for Simulation Integration" of phase 2 the framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfill are clarified. Also, the requirements of the simulation task are broken down into the individual requirements for the simulation integration elements. This is an iterative process between all steps of phase 2.

**Process Execution:**
- Clarification of framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfill
- Break down of the requirements of the simulation task into the individual requirements for the simulation integration
