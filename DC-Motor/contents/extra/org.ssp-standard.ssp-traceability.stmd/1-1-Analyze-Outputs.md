**Phase 1 "Analyze Simulation Task & Objectives**
Phase 1 "Analyze Simulation Task & Objectives contains information and a description of the engineering task of the higher-level engineering process as well the general requirements and objectives, e.g. KPI and other criteria for the simulation task (see also 2.1).

**Outputs:**

* **Specific, detailed description of product, requirements and environment (meant is the environment of the real product, e.g. for car -> road, climate zone, user group, frequency of use, â€¦)**
    * A variant of a window lifter based on the DDC platform is to be developed. This application is a low cost variant. In this simple example no further details are provided.
* **Analyzed simulation task and objectives (including KPI and other criteria)**
    * The simulation Task (sub-task) here is to make a pre-selection for a suitable DC electric motor in the early phase of the project. It is to be examined whether the DC motor with the type part number XY12346 is suitable in principle.
    * The DC motor must be able to accelerate from 0 to 50 rad/s within 0.5 s at 12 V applied voltage and a load torque of -0.5 Nm.
    * Parameter: New motor after 20 min running-in and 20 degrees Celsius.
* **Detailed explanation why simulation was chosen as solution approach for the engineering task**
    * **Rationale:** Same approach in similar engineering tasks was performed successfully.
* **Specific quality aspects for the simulation task derived from the criticality of the decision of engineering task**
    * Proof of the basic applicability of the motor is required before further development work is required. Sufficient validation of the results and tools used by expert opinion and plausibility tests.
* **Credibility documentation:** Procedure documentation with quality assurance
    * The results and procedure were approved by simulation expert and product expert.
