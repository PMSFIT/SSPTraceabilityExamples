**Phase2 step4 Define Requirements for Test Cases**

**Inputs:**

* **Requirements for test cases (the test cases or optimization criteria targeting the simulation objective**)
    * The simulation starts with all state variables 0 (current, speed, position).
    * Voltage 12 V and load torque -0.5 Nm is applied.
    * Simulation should run for 1.0 sec.
    * Evaluation if after 0.5 sec 50 rad/s are reached.
* **Specific quality requirements for the cases**
    * Assurance of the results and used resources by expert assessment and plausibility tests is sufficient.
