**Phase 5 Execute Simulation**

In this process phase the simulation itself as well as simulation experiments relevant for the following evaluation and quality assurance are carried out. Single simulations, a given set of simulations or iterative simulations can be performed here. Phase 5 and 6 are an iterative process, results are documented in the according phases.

**Outputs:**
- Simulation results
- Quality information of simulation experiments (e.g error estimations or confidence range)
